**Overview**

This project aims to predict the closing price of stocks using regression analysis with multiple models. By comparing the evaluation metrics of various models, 
we identify the best-performing model for stock price prediction.

**Objective**

The primary objective is to develop a robust model that accurately predicts the closing price of stocks. 
This predictive capability can assist investors and traders in making informed decisions about buying, selling, or holding stocks.

**Conclusion**

Through this project, we demonstrate the effectiveness of regression analysis in predicting stock prices and identify the most suitable model for the task. 
By leveraging machine learning techniques, we provide valuable insights to stakeholders in the financial domain
